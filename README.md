> Tactical Sandbox is a mission launcher designed to be tailored exactly the way you want.
> Experience the ultimate freedom in mission planning and execution.

## ⭐️ KEY FEATURES

**Universal Compatibility**
The system automatically adapts to your installed Mods and DLCs.

**Dynamic Gameplay**

- **Detailed Briefings:** All missions include specific task instructions.
- **Infinite Replayability:** Every objective takes place in a different location with over **50+ possible areas per mission**
- **⚠️ Permadeath System:** Survival truly matters. If you fall, the consequences are real.
Revive or medical overhaul mods don’t fully adapt to this mission, but you can switch to a nearby AI teammate if your character dies.

## 🏢 THE HEADQUARTERS

![Headquarters](Slide14.JPG)

Prepare for your mission in a fully interactive HQ featuring specialized zones:

- **🔫 1. Virtual Arsenal:** Choose your uniforms, patches, weapons, and gear without restriction.
- **⛅ 2. Weather & Time Room:** Take full control over the time of day and all weather conditions (Fog, Rain, Storms, Clear Skies).
- **🗺️ 3. Mission Selector:** Choose from multiple dynamic mission types suited to your mood.
- **🪖 4. Recruitment Center:** Build and customize your AI squad (*"Brothers in Arms"*). Add or remove soldiers at any time.
New units appear seamlessly, and friendly forces will wear the uniforms from your loaded mods.
Allies appearing in missions (via helicopter or others) will wear the server players' outfits (it's better for immersion!).
- **🎯 5. Enemy Selector:** Customize opposing forces. *Note: Default vanilla units are included, but you are free to use **ANY** OPFOR or Independent faction.*
You must modify the enemies before launching a mission (the selected enemies will be the mission's enemies).
- **🚙 6. Garage:** Select your transport.
Choose from a wide variety of ground vehicles and helicopters.

Allies appearing in missions (via helicopter or others) will wear the server players' outfits (it's better for immersion!).

**Dynamic Gameplay**

- **Detailed Briefings:** All missions include specific task instructions.
- **Infinite Replayability:** Every objective takes place in a different location with over **50+ possible areas per mission**.
- **⚠️ Permadeath System:** Survival truly matters. If you fall, the consequences are real.
